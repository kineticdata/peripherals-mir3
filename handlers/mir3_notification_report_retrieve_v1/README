=== Detailed Description
Using Mir3's SOAP API, an API call is made using a notification id to retrieve a single notification
report that matches the inputted id. The SOAP request body is then created with the authentication
values and the notification id and passed to the getNotificationReportsOp SOAP Action. If successful,
the XML results will contain simple string representations of the fields that the Mir3 API returns.
The only exception to this is the Response Options JSON field, which is a JSON representation of the
XML that is returned with the User response statistics for the returned notification. This handler
is currently using version 4.14 of the Mir3 API.
