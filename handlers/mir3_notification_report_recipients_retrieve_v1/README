=== Detailed Description
Using Mir3's SOAP API, an API call is made using a notification id and a query type to retrieve the
receipients of a single notification. The SOAP request body is created with the authentication
values, the notification id, and whatever query information is needed and is then passed to the
getNotificationReportRecipientsOp SOAP Action. If successful, the XML results will contain simple
string representations of the fields that the Mir3 API returns. The only exception to this is the
Recipients JSON field, which is a JSON representation of the XML that is returned with the User
response statistics for the returned notification. This handler is currently using version 4.14 of
the Mir3 API.
