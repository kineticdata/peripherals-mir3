=== Detailed Description
Using Mir3's SOAP API, an API call is made to send a new simple notification that is built using the
inputted properties. The SOAP request body is created based on what type of notification method is
chosen (Broadcast, First Response, Callout, or Bulletin Board) and is then sent to the Users
associated with the usernames from the comma separated recipient list. The current options available
just represent the minimal message that can be sent and much more can be done with the Mir3 API if
the handler is updated/forked to use these extra capabilities. On a successful call, a Notification
Report Id will be returned which can be used to check the notification status. This handler is
currently using version 4.14 of the Mir3 API.
