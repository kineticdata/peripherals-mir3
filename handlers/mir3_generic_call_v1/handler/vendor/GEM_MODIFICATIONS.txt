The following modifications were made to the vendor libraries in order to make
them compatible with the Kinetic Task process:
 * Added the VERSION constant to the Builder class in the
   lib\builder\xmlbase.rb file at line 6.

 2020-04-20:
 *  Savon-2.12.0/lib/savon/soap_fault.rb
    Added line 10 to handle situations where the returned SOAP response included
    matching fault data in a CDATA element. CDATA should not be evaluated for
    these errors

    xml.slice!(/<!\[CDATA(?:(?!<!\[CDATA).)*?\]\]>/m)
